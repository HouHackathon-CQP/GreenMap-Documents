- Social media accounts
- Community events (online and offline)
- When representing the project in public spaces

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**conduct@greenmap.example.com**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

- Description of the incident
- When and where the incident occurred
- Whether the incident is ongoing
- Any additional context or information
- If you believe anyone is at immediate physical risk

### Confidentiality

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of GreenMap members or the general public.
