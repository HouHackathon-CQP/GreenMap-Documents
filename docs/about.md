# About GreenMap

## Project Overview

GreenMap is an innovative open-source platform designed to connect people with environmental initiatives and promote sustainable actions in communities worldwide. Our mission is to make environmental activism accessible, measurable, and impactful for everyone.

## Our Story

### The Beginning

GreenMap was born during the HouHackathon-CQP hackathon, where a group of passionate developers and environmental advocates came together with a common goal: to create a tool that would make it easier for people to find and participate in environmental projects.

### The Problem We Solve

Before GreenMap:
- Environmental projects were scattered across various platforms
- Difficult to discover local green initiatives
- No centralized way to track environmental impact
- Limited tools for project organizers
- Lack of community engagement features

### Our Solution

GreenMap provides:
- **Centralized Platform**: One place to discover all environmental projects
- **Interactive Mapping**: Visual representation of green initiatives
- **Impact Tracking**: Measurable results and progress
- **Community Building**: Connect with like-minded individuals
- **Organizer Tools**: Easy project management for leaders

## Our Mission

To empower individuals and communities to take meaningful environmental action by providing accessible, engaging, and effective tools for discovering, organizing, and participating in green initiatives.

## Our Vision

We envision a world where:
- Every person can easily find and join environmental projects
- Communities are connected through shared environmental goals
- Environmental impact is transparent and measurable
- Sustainable actions are gamified and rewarding
- Technology serves as a bridge between intention and action
